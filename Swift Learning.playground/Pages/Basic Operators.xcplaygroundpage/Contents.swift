// Operators are unary, binary, or ternary
//Unary operators operate on a single target (such as -a). Unary prefix operators appear immediately before their target (such as !b), and unary postfix operators appear immediately after their target (such as c!).
//Binary operators operate on two targets (such as 2 + 3) and are infix because they appear in between their two targets.
//Ternary operators operate on three targets. Like C, Swift has only one ternary operator, the ternary conditional operator (a ? b : c).


// Assignment Operator ->  (a = b)

// Arithmetic Operators
    // Addition (+)
    // Subtraction (-)
    // Multiplication (*)
    // Division (/)

    // Remainder Operator ->  9 % 4 equals 1
    // Unary Minus Operator -> -3
    // Unary Plus Operator -> +3

// Compound Assignment Operators - +=


// Comparison Operators
    // Equal to (a == b)
    // Not equal to (a != b)
    // Greater than (a > b)
    // Less than (a < b)
    // Greater than or equal to (a >= b)
    // Less than or equal to (a <= b)


// Ternary Conditional Operator -> question ? answer1 : answer2

// Nil-Coalescing Operator -> a ?? b

// Range Operators
    // Closed Range Operator -> a...b
    // Half-Open Range Operator -> a..<b
    // One-Sided Ranges -> for name in names[2...] { }


// Logical Operators
    // Logical NOT (!a)
    // Logical AND (a && b)
    // Logical OR (a || b)
